							I'm a native Richmonder. Upon my arrival into the adult world I
							was at a stalemate with what I wanted to do. I did the college
							thing for a little while and ultimately ended up working full
							time.I downloaded a few coding apps and I dipped my toes into the
							water, and found out it wasn't very cold. I really enjoyed the
							puzzles and solutions I was able to come up with. With this new
							found hobby I decided to take a dive and signed up for the the
							University of Richmond's Full Stack Bootcamp. When I'm not coding
							or at work I love to skateboard with my friends and play music.
