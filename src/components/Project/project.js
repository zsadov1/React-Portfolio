						My name is Zachary Sadovszky. I'm a native Richmonder, I grew up in
						the West End and moved to the city when I was 18. Upon my arrival
						into the adult world I was at a stalemate with what I wanted to do.
						I did the college thing for a little while and ultimately ended up
						working full time selling suits. I found that job unfulfilling and
						wanted to change my course. I started teaching at a school for
						individuals on the autism spectrum. This job was rewarding, but the
						level of stress proved to be too much. I transitioned to teaching
						neuro-typical children. I taughet pre-school, after-school, and
						after working a summer camp I realized that wasn't the field for me.
						My best friend taught himself to code and got great job after great
						job with this skill. I saw an oppurtunity to make a career change
						and ultimately put me in the place I wanted to be. I downloaded a
						few apps and with the help of my friend dipped my toes into the
						water, and found out it wasn't very cold. I really enjoyed the
						puzzles and solutions I was able to come up with. With this new
						found hobby I decided to take a dive into the water and join the
						University of Richmond's Full Stack Bootcamp. When I'm not in class
						or at work I love to skateboard with my friends and play music.
